# SheGun

A 2D sidescrolling action platformer. Player uses a shotgun and movement abilities to clear combat and platforming challenges.

The idea is that the recoil of the shotgun is used as a movement mechanic, allowing the player to dodge attacks.
The shotgun can also be used to interact with the environment; triggering switches, breaking glass, cutting ropes, etc.

Features implemented:

- Complete first stage
- Attack system (Firing shotgun)
- Movement system (Run, jump, recoil movement)
- 2 unique enemy types
- Moving platforms

Made with Unity

Status: Abandoned (due to prototype not quite feeling fun)

Will not be updated
